UNSCHEDULE ARCHIVED FLOWS
----------------------------
This script is used to unschedule archived flows with scheduled runs in Prefect.
- Everytime a flow is registered in Prefect, a new version is created and the old versions archived.
- Sometimes, the old versions have remaining scheduled runs, which can cause issues. We call then GHOST RUNS.
- This script queries the Prefect API for archived flows with scheduled runs and unschedules them.
- Adapted from SMTR's flow called Janitor
