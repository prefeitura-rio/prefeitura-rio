"""
Metrics implementations for the prefeitura_rio package.

In this module, we define the metrics that will be used to evaluate the
performance of the models. The metrics are defined as functions that take
the true and predicted values as input and return a single value.

In the `agnostic` module, we define metrics that are agnostic to any
framework. In the `tensorflow` module, we define metrics that leverage
TensorFlow's backend.
